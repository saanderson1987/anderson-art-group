TO DO

FRONT END
-get rid of bootstrap: will have to modify nav bar and make sure reset is OK.
-edit buttons: cancel should be a button in the style of 'create new', maybe the check, too.
-sort: add sort to list: will have to add a sort param in API.
-get companies tabs working: create companies/clients, prospects api route


API
-extract API from project. should have two apps. i think.
-see sort requirement in front end
-create /companies/clients, prospects api route for companies tabs.
